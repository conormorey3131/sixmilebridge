        <p>The Town Team is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to The Town Team Web site and governs data collection and usage. By using The Town Team website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>

        <h3>1. Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The Town Team collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number for the purposes of registering your details as a member of The Town Team  or a contact person from a member organisation of The Town Team, or as a participant/registrant for an event organised by The Town Team. Except to the extent required in some circumstances e.g. special dietary requirements, The Town Team does not request any other personal information.</p>
        <p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by The Town Team. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by The Town Team for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Town Team Web site.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through any Town Team public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: The Town Team does not read any of your private online communications.</p>
        <p>The Town Team encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to through The Town Team so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. The Town Team is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Town Team.</p>

        <h3>2. Use of your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The Town Team collects and uses your personal information to operate The Town Team Web site and deliver the services you have requested. The Town Team also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from The Town Team through its main website or affiliate websites. The Town Team may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of the sector, current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
        <p>The Town Team does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. The Town Team may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, The Town Team may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except in their provision of these services to The Town Team, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
        <p>The Town Team keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within our website in order to determine what services are most frequently used. These results are used to deliver customised content and promotion within The Town Team to customers whose behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
        <p>The Town Team Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on The Town Team or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of The Town Team; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of The Town Team, or the public.</p>

        <h3>3. Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>The Town Team Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise The Town Team pages, or register with The Town Team site or services, a cookie helps The Town Team to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same The Town Team Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customised.</p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of The Town Team services or Web sites you visit.</p>

        <h3>4. Security of your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The Town Team takes all reasonable steps to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure and secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

        <h3>5. Removing or updating your information</h3>
        <p>If you wish to update or remove information previously provided to The Town Team or wish to no longer be contacted by The Town Team please contact the Town Team on its email address with details of your specific request and your request will be actioned.</p>

        <h3>6. Changes to this Statement</h3>
        <p>The Town Team will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. The Town Team encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how The Town Team is protecting your information.</p>

        <h3>7. Contact Information</h3>
        <p>The Town Team welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that The Town Team has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the Administrator via the Town Team email address. The Town Team will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
