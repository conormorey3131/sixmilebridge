                    <p>Sixmilebridge has a long and proud history that dates back to the early medieval period. Its name derives from a historic river crossing over the O'Garney River - a vital trade route in centuries past from places such as the Netherlands. Many old original street names are steeped in Dutch history. Evidence of ancient settlements, ringforts, and traditional architecture still mark the landscape today. Over time, Sixmilebridge has evolved into a thriving modern town that balances its heritage with progress and innovation.</p>
                    <p>The nearby Bunratty Castle & Folk Park offer an immersive glimpse into 19th-century rural life in Clare and Cragganuowen's viking history all complement the town's own sense of heritage and community identity.</p>
